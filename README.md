What you'll build
Together we will build a geometric, 2D platformer where you must fend off an assortment of different enemies for as long as you possibly can. We'll use vanilla JavaScript and math concepts to achieve the exact kind of play-style we want. Play the game below, just be sure to check out the instructions beneath it first!

 this example free complete game using nothing but a simple HTML file and vanilla JS. This allows for new dev-people or crazy nuts, new to web development to easily jump in and begin learning game dev, without the struggle of tooling setup or learning a new library. Your focus will solely be on the important game-dev concepts at hand, and nothing else.

Although you should be fine with minimal programming knowledge, intro tutorials and other important requirments have their needed resource links

No matter if you're new or experienced to development, you'll come out with a solid understanding of each of these following game-dev topics:

Canvas resizing
Object-oriented interactions
Player creation
Object management and garbage collection
Precise projectile shooting
Randomized enemy generation
Collision detection
Explosion generation on enemy hit
Start, end, and restart game functionality
Game interface and UI creation
Player movement
Unique enemies (static, tracking, spinning, and spinning-tracking)
Machine-gun power up
Sound effects and music
Interactive background on move and enemy removal
Mobile-responsiveness and touch events

and everyone of these are vital to make a game work ... but mimc exactly to functions and requirments to make web pages work dynamiclly
